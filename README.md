# Simracer Coin - Sim Racing eSports meets Crypto and Blockchain technology

[Verify Contract](https://etherscan.io/token/0x16587cf43f044aba0165ffa00acf412631194e4b)

Believers think that blockchain gaming will drive crypto mass adoption and will be the key to dreams such as Ready Player One. We believe it will disrupt gaming/eSports and, as sim racing enthusiasts, we want to drive crypto adoption in this growing eSport and bring even more fun and realism to the virtual tracks.

Simracer Coin, a standard ERC-20 Token deployed in the Ethereum Blokchain, will be the first step to achieve our vision. Many simracers spend a lot of time competing in several series just for fun. We believe in a 'race to own' model and, by leveraging our presence in the community and building partnerships with existent leagues, we want to offer this virtual champions our token as a prize and put their names on the blockchain forever.
